# App concept

## Idea definition
My idea is to realize an Android App which explains to a user something about the place I grew and lived till I was 25: Villafranca d'Asti, a small village in the province of Asti, Piedmont, Italy ;)
I would like to say something about the town and its history and to give some practical informations, such as how to get there or which services are provided to local population and visitors. 

## Target user
My target users are visitors that come to Villafranca for the first time or locals as well that want to know something more about their place or to easily access some practical information/address.
